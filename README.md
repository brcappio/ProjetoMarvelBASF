# BASF Frontend Internship Project
**Try it out at: https://brcappio.github.io/projetomarvelbasf/**

This is my project application project for the BASF Frontend Internship Project, in which we were asked to use the Marvel API and do whatever we wanted with it!

My idea was to build a application that would take a random Marvel Snap Card, search for the character from the card in the Marvel API and show information such as description, chapters the character appear and some more!

Its far from perfect, there is still a lot to be done but I learned a lot from this and it was really fun to do!

Built using React.
